## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

To report a vulnerability with the Ben bot, it is suggested that you either DM `.kindkid` on Discord directly or join the Ben Network Discord server and open a ticket.
I check my DMs frequently, so if you contact me that way, expect a reply within an hour.
the Ben Network discord server is pretty inactive so it may take a bit longer, but more people are available to help in there.

Security is important here, so reporting vulnerabilities would be really helpful and extremely appreciated.
